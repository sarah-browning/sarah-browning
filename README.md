# Hello there, friend! 👋

### Hello! My name is Sarah Browning and I'm a web programming student studying at NSCC Marconi Campus. I am currently seeking potential job opportunities for Spring 2022.

I have more than 15 years of experience in providing stellar customer service; however, I'm looking to transition to an IT career path. I consider myself to be a creative problem-solver at heart, and have found coding to be an incredibly fun challenge as a result. I've really enjoyed learning at NSCC and have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including React and Node.js. I'm currently learning React Native through a Udemy course and having a lot of fun with that. Additionally, I've had in class experience with PHP, Laravel, Java, Python, Swift, WordPress, Visual Basic, and both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

I am currently seeking employment and/or work placement opportunities for after graduation in the Spring. To that end, here is a copy of [my resume](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/blob/1600c9dc5c252a5d04e292ccdfd15c24eda0d79a/Sample%20Junior%20Web%20Developer%20Resume.pdf) and a sample [cover letter](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/blob/1600c9dc5c252a5d04e292ccdfd15c24eda0d79a/Sample%20Junior%20Web%20Developer%20Letter.pdf) that I wrote for a class assignment. If you like what you see, then I encourage you to look around at my current work samples and commit history to get an idea of my work process and code style. If paper portfolios are more your style, you'd like to see what I've been learning in my courses, or you want to see what certificates I've got, all that is [available right here](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/files/7653054/Portfolio-Y2-2021.pdf). I'm always available to chat and can be reached at 📫 browning.sarah.a@gmail.com, or through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-browning-dev/), or even right here on GitHub!
