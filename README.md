# Hello there, friend! 👋

### Hello! My name is Sarah Browning and I'm a Junior Web Developer who has recently graduated from the IT Web Programming course at NSCC Marconi Campus. I am currently seeking remote job opportunities in both front and back-end development.

I have more than 15 years of experience in providing stellar customer service; however, I'm looking to transition to an IT career path. I consider myself to be a creative problem-solver at heart, and have found coding to be an incredibly fun challenge as a result. I've really enjoyed learning at NSCC and have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including React and Node.js. I'm currently learning React Native through a Udemy course and having a lot of fun with that. Additionally, I've had in class experience with PHP, Laravel, Java, Python, Swift, WordPress, Visual Basic, and both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

If you're interested in getting to know me better, then I encourage you to pop over to my [portfolio website](https://sarahbrowning.codes) or take a look around at my current work samples and commit history to get an idea of my work process and code style. If paper portfolios are more your style,and you'd like to see what I've been learning in my courses, or you want to see what certificates I've got, all that is [available right here](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/files/7653054/Portfolio-Y2-2021.pdf). I'm always available to chat and can be reached at 📫 [by email](mailto:browning.sarah.a@gmail.com), through my [website](https://sarahbrowning.codes), my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-browning-dev/), or even right here on GitHub!
