# Hello there, friend! 👋

### My name is **Sarah Browning** and I'm a 2nd-year web programming student studying at NSCC Marconi Campus.

I am looking to transition into a career in web development after spending more than 15 years in customer service and retail roles.  I consider myself to be a creative problem-solver at heart, and have found coding to be an incredibly fun challenge as a result.

I am currently seeking employment and/or work placement opportunities for after graduation in the Spring.  To that end, here is a copy of [my resume](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/files/7652610/Browning.Sarah.-.2021.Resume.-.Junior.Web.Developer.pdf) and a sample [cover letter](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/files/7652617/Browning.Sarah.-.2021.Cover.Letter.-.Junior.Web.Developer.pdf) that I wrote for a class assignment.

If you like what you see, then I encourage you to look around at my current work samples and commit history to get an idea of my work process and code style.  If paper portfolios are more your style, you'd like to see what I've been learning in my courses, or you want to see what certificates I've got, all that is [available right here](https://github.com/sarah-browning/sarah-browning/files/7653054/Portfolio-Y2-2021.pdf).  I'm always available to chat and can be reached at 📫 browning.sarah.a@gmail.com, or through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-browning-dev/), or even right here on GitHub!

My favorite language to work with so far is Java, and my favorite Java project I've done is my Space Invaders clone.  It's far from perfect, but you can check out the code in my repo below.  I'm hoping I can tweak it a bit more over the Christmas break.  Beyond that, I'm enjoying PHP/Laravel and React/Node a lot as well.
